# Travel Diary

Travel Diary allows people to store their trip information (Cities, States, photos, and descriptions) on the web to be easily accessed and shared with friends from wherever they may be.

Their trip data can even be searched to allow them to share an adventure directly. Favorite trips can be designated.
