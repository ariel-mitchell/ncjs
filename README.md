# Travel Diary
From the members of NCJS, our project serves as a personal portfolio/digital scrapbook for trips that our users take.  Having an application dedicated to storing vacation/trip memories is a great alternative to scrolling for miles in your photos to find the one you’re looking for. We’ve developed an app that creates an unique folder for each trip the user has taken that stores photos and trip descriptions in each folder. Be the main character in your journey! 

## Description

Travel Diary allows people to store their trip information (Cities, States, photos, and descriptions) on the web to be easily accessed and shared with friends from wherever they may be. Each trip is stored in an unique folder, which stores photos and trip descriptions.

Trips are only visible to the user who stored their photos and descriptions in the app, ensuring privacy.

Trip data can be searched to allow travelers to find a specific adventure for reminiscing or sharing. Favorite trips can be designated as a "favorite".

### Installation
Feel free to download our application to your local machine!
* Fork this repository to create your own branch to your local system.
  - Download an integrated development environment that can read java- we recommend IntelliJ which we used to make this application.
  - Clone the repository using the HTTPS link either by accessing program through version control link on your software or using terminal.

### Execution
For now, our development team is still working on deployment strategies. _The only way to execute code is to run a bootrun program through Gradle to access in your localhost._ Please contact us if you'd like to booster your coding portfolio and contribute to the deployment of our application! If you're interested in our mission and you got the skills, we would love to talk about having you on our team :^)
