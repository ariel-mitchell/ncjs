LaunchCode LiftOff Project

Purpose: 
Our project will serve as a personal portfolio for trips that our users take!  We think that having an application dedicated to storing vacation/trip memories would be great in comparison to scrolling for miles in your   photos to find the one you’re looking for.  We’ll develop an app that will create a folder for each trip the user has taken.  You will be able to store photos and trip descriptions in each folder with the option of sharing them on social media!
